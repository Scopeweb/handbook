# Roadmap Prioritisation

For the benefit of epic teams, the Supports Client Portal Board needs to show the current cross-customer priorities.

Before the close of play at the end of each week, the current customer priorities should be discussed by everyone who had a prioritisation conversation with the customer that week. You'll see a friendly reminder in the `#support` Microsoft Teams group.

If you're not going to be around towards the end of the week, please ensure you've shared your customer priorities before you leave.

If you need to repriortise during the week, please be encouraged to do so. Ensure you're having conversations with other people who have roadmap tasks that may be affected.
