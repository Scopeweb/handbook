# Raising an Issue

From time to time people may have problems or concerns about their colleagues, customers, company leadership, work environment and so forth. We want everyone in the organization to be empowered to raise an issue and have it dealt with swiftly and fairly.

## Have a conversation with the person involved

The first thing you can do, if you feel comfortable and able, is raise the issue directly with the person involved. This type of direct and informal approach is encouraged and we expect your colleagues who are approached responsibly to respond in a similar manner. This approach may be particularly appropriate to dealing with matters of speech and expression, where individuals may not be aware that their behavior is causing distress.

## Raise feedback via Continuous Feedback

If you feel unable to have a conversation directly with the person involved, and they are a member of staff at Scope Web, then you can encourage them to discuss the issue in their next [continuous feedback](../../team-norms/continuous_feedback.md) session by raising the feedback through that process.

Continuous feedback is not anonymous but can add a layer of indirection and ensure that the issue is discussed with another member of the team. We hope this will trigger conversations amongst those in the session and we would expect proactive action to happen off the back of that session.

## Ask a colleague to intervene on your behalf

You may ask a colleague or executive to intervene informally on your behalf. In some situations, you may not feel able to directly approach the person or people involved and so going via a third party to informally raise your concern for you is another option available to you.

In particular, if you have a grievance with an executive and feel unable to raise it directly, you should raise this issue either with another executive or with a colleague who can raise it with an executive for you.

## Seek Third Party Advice

We provide staff access to a [employee wellbeing service](employee_assistance.md) which includes a phone number you can call for third party advice on HR issues.

## Mediation

At the time of writing we do not have anyone with mediation training at the company but if necessary we can bring in third party mediators to deal with disputes informally.

If you wish to enter a mediation process, please ask an executive or ask a colleague to go to an executive to request mediation.
