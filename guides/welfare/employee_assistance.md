# Employee Assistance

We are working on setting up an employee assistance programme to provide our team self-service access to all kinds of help. The confidential service provides:

- Legal advice (for personal and work)
- Emotional help and counselling
- External HR advice (completely unbiased help and support)
- Health (pregnancy, sickness, personal injury, stress)
- Family (rights, divorce, child support, teenagers)
- Older people (bereavement, elderly care, support)
- Financial advice (pay, pensions, tax, debt help, benefits)
- Relationships (divorce & separation, counselling, bullying)
- Addiction (substance and gambling, support for family, rehabilitation

## Getting assistance

We are still working out which provider is best suitable for our business, meanwhile you can always consult one of the Executives for further information. They will help you get started into a program that is currently best suitable.

## Confidentiality

We will be informed when the phone line and online service is used, and we will be alerted to what category of query/advice was made. We will not be provided any other details on the contents of your call or use of the service, nor will we be told who accessed the service.
