# Fortnite Friday

Every Friday, we try and come together to play some games, whether it be Fortnite or anything else, we're very competitive. This makes a great moment for the team to socialize.

As Fortnite is exclusionary in nature to those who don't like to be around video games, we make efforts to make sure it's not the center of our culture whilst at the same time acknowledging it's important to some.

A few basic rules:

* When going for Fortnite Fridays, we'll stop work a little bit early, and one of the executives will invite the others to join the gaming session. Once the executives leave the session, you're on your own and the wins are on your own tab ;-)

* Remember you're still representing the business when you are out winning video games. Be respectful and decent at all times.

* Where possible, and appropriate, encourage customers to join us for games. 

* We encourage you to invite friends of Scope Web and people we might consider hiring to Fortnite Fridays. It's a good opportunity to meet both socially.
